00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,080
I

2
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,320
think

3
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,480
it's

4
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,880
important

5
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,040

7
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,160
why

8
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,480
it's

9
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,720
not

10
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:02,960
just

11
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,459
about

12
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:03,839
a

13
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:04,240

14
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,719

20
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,320

26
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,599
But

27
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:07,919
there's

28
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,400

218
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,379
there

219
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:07,700
isn't

220
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,200

00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:08,739
things

224
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:08,900
that

225
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,060
I

226
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,540
thought

227
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,780
were

228
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,280
reliable

229
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:10,840
before,

230
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:11,620
I

231
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,939
start

232
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,019
to

233
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:12,260
have

234
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,500
real

235
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,980
questions

236
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,140
in

237
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,299
the

238
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:13,700
soundness

239
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:13,859
of

240
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:14,019
the

241
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:14,420

242
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,920
overall.

243
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:15,174
And

244
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:15,415
that's

245
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:15,575
why

246
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:15,655
it's

247
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:15,814
so

248
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:16,295
