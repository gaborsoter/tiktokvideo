1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,983
I think it's important to

2
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:02,910
highlight why it's not just

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:05,059
about a couple hundred tech

4
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:06,364
bros in Silicon Valley not

5
00:00:06,384 --> 00:00:07,408
being able to make payroll,

6
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:08,452
but there's important

7
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:09,898
downstream consequences.

8
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,902
For example,

9
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:12,610
there are payment processing companies

10
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:14,178
in Silicon Valley that use

11
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,449
Silicon Valley Bank to store

12
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:17,595
their capital and to move

13
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:18,117
money around.

14
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,804
There are payroll companies

15
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,053
that do payroll for many businesses,

16
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:23,178
not just tech businesses,

17
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,529
but many businesses in different parts of the economy

18
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,044
that store their cash at Silicon Valley Bank

19
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:30,038
and process money through Silicon Valley Bank.

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,064
Today it was announced that

21
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:32,852
Rippling, one of those companies,

22
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,024
could not hit their payroll cycle today

23
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,514
because they had money tied up at

24
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:37,259
Silicon Valley Bank.

25
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,626
Fortunately, they announced that

26
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:40,074
they also have money at JPMorgan

27
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:41,561
and other places, so they will

28
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:42,887
be able to kind of get the

29
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,097
payroll processed early next week

30
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:46,350
and get everyone back on track.

31
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,385
But this is hundreds and potentially

32
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:50,352
thousands of companies that use

33
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:53,528
their payroll software to process and

34
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,616
pay their employees.

35
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,784
You can start to see

36
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:56,328
how there can be

37
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,119
very significant trickling effects.

38
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,023
And more importantly,

39
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,067
like we saw in 08,

40
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,614
perhaps to a different degree,

41
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:03,381
but still a significant concern

42
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,010
is the contagion of panic,

43
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:07,074
where people say,

44
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:08,339
if there isn't reliability

45
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,242
in the things that I thought

46
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,768
were reliable before,

47
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:12,916
I start to have real questions

48
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:14,793
in the soundness of the system overall.

49
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,325
And that's why it's so important,

50
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:17,008
as Zach said,

51
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:18,012
to step in,

52
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:19,784
shore up the problem this weekend.

53
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,064
I don't think it's about

54
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,011
bidding 50 cents or 60 cents

55
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:22,495
on the dollar.

56
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,587
Every depositor needs to get

57
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:25,733
paid 100% of their money,

58
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:26,979
and that cash needs to be

59
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,332
made available to them by

60
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:29,079
early next week.

61
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,846
And if that money is not available to them

62
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:34,944
within the first 48 or 72 hours of the end of this weekend,

63
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,096
then we're going to have a real crisis on our hands,

64
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,151
because then you will see a lot of people trying to move money

65
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:43,287
away from any institution that stores their money in some sort of security

66
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:45,278
that's not 100% liquid like cash.

67
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:45,943
That's going to

68
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:46,875
cause a massive run.

69
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,565
And so what has to happen,

70
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,753
the only way this can happen is if

71
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:52,982
someone takes over Silicon Valley Bank

72
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,171
this weekend, and that the federal

73
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,878
government, unfortunately, as much as

74
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,108
I hate to say it, because I absolutely

75
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,254
hate the federal government having a

76
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,424
role in this stuff, has to say we will

77
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:04,673
guarantee 100% of those deposits to

78
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:06,279
the company that takes over the bank

79
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,268
that takes over this portfolio, and says,

80
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,835
let the portfolio of assets run its

81
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,644
lifetime, see what you get paid,

82
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:13,797
whatever the delta is, we'll make it up to you.

83
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,984
But we need to make sure

84
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,311
that there's cash here today,

85
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:17,719
for all of these depositors

86
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:18,473
to get paid tomorrow.

87
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,149
You had something

88
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,499
you want to say?
