I think it's important to
highlight why it's not
just about a couple hundred
Tech Bros in Silicon Valley
not being able to make payroll.
But there's important downstream consequences
For example, there are payment
processing companies in Silicon Valley
that use Silicon Valley Bank
to store their capital and
to move money around.
There are payroll companies that
do payroll for many businesses,
not just tech businesses,
but many businesses in different
parts of the economy that
store their cash at Silicon Valley Bank
and process money through Silicon Valley Bank.
Today, it was announced that
Rippling, one of those companies
could not hit their payroll cycle
today because they had
money tied up at Silicon Valley Bank.
Fortunately, they announced that they
also have money at JPMorgan
and other places so they
will be able to kinda
get the payroll processed early
next week and and get everyone back on track.
But this is hundreds and
potentially thousands of companies that
use their payroll software to
to process and and pay their employees.
You can start to see
how there can be very
significant trickling effects and more
importantly, like we saw in
o eight, perhaps to a
different degree, but still
a significant concern is the
contagion of Panic.
Where people say if there
isn't reliability in the things
that I thought were reliable
before, I start to have
real questions in the soundness
of the system overall.
And that's why it's so important
as Saks said to step in
shore up the problem this weekend.
I don't think it's about
bidding fifty cents or sixty cents
on the dollar.
Every depositor needs to get
paid a hundred percent of
their money.
And that cash needs to
be made available to them
by early next week.
And if that money is
not available to them,
within the first forty eight
or seventy two hours of
the end of this weekend,
then we are going to
have a real crisis on
our hands because then you
will see a lot of people
trying to move money away
from any institution that stores
their money in some sort
of security that's not
a hundred percent liquid like cash.
That's gonna cost a massive run.
And so what has to happen,
the only way this can happen
is if someone takes over
Silicon Valley Bank this weekend
And that the federal government,
unfortunately, as much as I hate to say it,
because I absolutely hate the federal government having a role in this stuff.
Has to say, we will guarantee
a hundred percent of those deposits
to the company that takes over,
the bank that takes over this portfolio
and says, let the portfolio of assets run its lifetime
see what you get paid,
whatever the delta is,
we'll make it up to you.
But we need to make sure
that there's cash here today
for all of these depositors
to get paid tomorrow.
Shamak, you had something you
want to say?
