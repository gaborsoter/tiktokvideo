1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
I think it's important to

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,720
highlight why it's not

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,719
just about a couple hundred

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,160
Tech Bros in Silicon Valley

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,440
not being able to make payroll.

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,539
But there's important downstream consequences

7
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:11,585
For example, there are payment

8
00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:13,605
processing companies in Silicon Valley

9
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,445
that use Silicon Valley Bank

10
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,184
to store their capital and

11
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,350
to move money around.

12
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:20,350
There are payroll companies that

13
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,969
do payroll for many businesses,

14
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,170
not just tech businesses,

15
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,750
but many businesses in different

16
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,125
parts of the economy that

17
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,964
store their cash at Silicon Valley Bank

18
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,045
and process money through Silicon Valley Bank.

19
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:31,164
Today, it was announced that

20
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,945
Rippling, one of those companies

21
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,810
could not hit their payroll cycle

22
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,850
today because they had

23
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,289
money tied up at Silicon Valley Bank.

24
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:38,649
Fortunately, they announced that they

25
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:39,929
also have money at JPMorgan

26
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,274
and other places so they

27
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,554
will be able to kinda

28
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:44,174
get the payroll processed early

29
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,155
next week and and get everyone back on track.

30
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:47,674
But this is hundreds and

31
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,710
potentially thousands of companies that

32
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,130
use their payroll software to

33
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,030
to process and and pay their employees.

34
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,630
You can start to see

35
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,429
how there can be very

36
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,225
significant trickling effects and more

37
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,585
importantly, like we saw in

38
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:00,704
o eight, perhaps to a

39
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:02,064
different degree, but still

40
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,224
a significant concern is the

41
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:05,584
contagion of Panic.

42
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,140
Where people say if there

43
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,500
isn't reliability in the things

44
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,780
that I thought were reliable

45
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,019
before, I start to have

46
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,299
real questions in the soundness

47
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,420
of the system overall.

48
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,814
And that's why it's so important

49
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,734
as Saks said to step in

50
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,415
shore up the problem this weekend.

51
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:20,454
I don't think it's about

52
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:21,734
bidding fifty cents or sixty cents

53
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:22,295
on the dollar.

54
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:24,409
Every depositor needs to get

55
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:25,370
paid a hundred percent of

56
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,609
their money.

57
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:26,730
And that cash needs to

58
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,769
be made available to them

59
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:28,890
by early next week.

60
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,769
And if that money is

61
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:30,650
not available to them,

62
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,545
within the first forty eight

63
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:33,825
or seventy two hours of

64
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:34,545
the end of this weekend,

65
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:35,825
then we are going to

66
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:36,625
have a real crisis on

67
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,665
our hands because then you

68
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:38,784
will see a lot of people

69
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:40,129
trying to move money away

70
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:41,489
from any institution that stores

71
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:42,530
their money in some sort

72
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,650
of security that's not

73
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,090
a hundred percent liquid like cash.

74
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,609
That's gonna cost a massive run.

75
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,125
And so what has to happen,

76
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,724
the only way this can happen

77
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:51,405
is if someone takes over

78
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,484
Silicon Valley Bank this weekend

79
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:55,140
And that the federal government,

80
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,620
unfortunately, as much as I hate to say it,

81
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,819
because I absolutely hate the federal government having a role in this stuff.

82
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,245
Has to say, we will guarantee

83
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,685
a hundred percent of those deposits

84
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,685
to the company that takes over,

85
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,045
the bank that takes over this portfolio

86
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,925
and says, let the portfolio of assets run its lifetime

87
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:11,370
see what you get paid,

88
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,729
whatever the delta is,

89
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:13,689
we'll make it up to you.

90
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,810
But we need to make sure

91
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,849
that there's cash here today

92
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,129
for all of these depositors

93
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,009
to get paid tomorrow.

94
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:18,810
Shamak, you had something you

95
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,289
want to say?
