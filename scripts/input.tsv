0	5780	I think it's important to highlight why it's not just about a couple 100 tech bros in Silicon
5780	9760	Valley not being able to make payroll, but there's important downstream consequences.
10400	14520	For example, there are payment processing companies in Silicon Valley that use Silicon
14520	20300	Valley Bank to store their capital and to move money around. There are payroll companies that
20300	24720	do payroll for many businesses, not just tech businesses, but many businesses in different
24720	29300	parts of the economy that store their cash at Silicon Valley Bank and process money through
29300	33460	Silicon Valley Bank. Today, it was announced that Rippling, one of those companies, could
33460	37240	not hit their payroll cycle today, because they had money tied up at Silicon Valley Bank.
37420	40600	Fortunately, they announced that they also have money at JP Morgan and other places.
40600	45920	So they will be able to kind of get the payroll processed early next week and get everyone back
45920	50960	on track. But this is hundreds and potentially 1000s of companies that use their payroll
50960	56620	software to process and pay their employees. You can start to see how there can be very
56780	60040	significant trickling effects. And more importantly, like we saw in a weight,
60420	66000	perhaps to a different degree, but still a significant concern is the contagion of panic,
66320	70700	where people say if there isn't reliability and the things that I thought were reliable before,
71240	75840	I start to have real questions in the soundness of the system overall. And that's why it's so
75840	80480	important to sack said to step in shore up the problem this weekend, I don't think it's about
80480	85720	bidding 50 cents or 60 cents on the dollar, every depositor needs to get paid 100% of their money.
85720	90060	And that cash needs to be made available to them by early next week. And if that money is not
90060	95860	available to them, within the first 48 or 72 hours of the end of this weekend, then we're going to
95860	100360	have a real crisis on our hands. Because then you will see a lot of people trying to move money away
100360	104940	from any institution that stores their money in some sort of security that's not 100% liquid like
104940	109980	cash, that's going to cause a massive run. And so what has to happen, the only way this can happen
109980	115620	is if someone takes over Silicon Valley Bank this weekend, and that the federal government
115840	119920	unfortunately, as much as I hate to say it, because I absolutely hate the federal government
119920	125240	having a role in this stuff has to say we will guarantee 100% of those deposits to the company
125240	129480	that takes over the bank that takes over this portfolio, and says let the portfolio of assets
129480	134560	run its lifetime, see what you get paid, whatever the delta is, we'll make it up to you. But we need
134560	138840	to make sure that there's cash here today for all of these depositors to get tomorrow had something
138840	139300	you want to say.
